This Words and Paragraphs Counter web app has a modern UI with two sections: a stats panel (left) and a text input area (right). It dynamically counts characters, words, and characters without spaces using JavaScript. The design features a teal background, soft rounded edges, and a clean layout, making it user-friendly and visually appealing.
